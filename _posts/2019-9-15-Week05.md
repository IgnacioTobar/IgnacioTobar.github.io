## BPR: Bayesian personalized ranking from implicit feedback

The paper describes a optimization criterion for personalized rankings, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). BPR, instead of taking one item and trying to independently calculate its score, works with item *pairs*, its objective is to rank these two items compared to each other.

The paper evaluates the BPR approach by applying it to two other popular recommender methods: matrix factorization and KNN. The results of the paper show that the methods using BPR clearly outperformed the ones without.

The paper clearly explains the BPR criterion, and the matrix factorization and KNN methods, which make it easy to follow. One problem though, is that it refers extensively to the "Area under the ROC curve" (AUC) without ever really explaining what it means or how it's relevant. Which forces the reader to consult outside material if not aware of this, making the paper harder to understand.
