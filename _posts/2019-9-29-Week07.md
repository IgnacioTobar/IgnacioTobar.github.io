## Ensemble Recommendations via Thompson Sampling: an Experimental Study within e-Commerce

The paper  is about the application of Thompson Sampling bandit policy, a heuristic for the multi-armed bandit problem, used in reinforced learning. This policy is applied to a recommender system for different e-Commerces.

Thompson Sampling works by modeling the reward distribution of the different "bandits", and sampling from each distribution according to that probability, to then choose the best one (in this case each bandit would be a different recommender criteria).  

The paper managed to demonstrate that Thompson Sampling is adequate to recommend, obtaining better results that the other baselines. If I have to criticize something is that the paper only compares their model with baselines like *best-sellers*, it would be interesting to see how their model compares to other traditional recommender systems approaches seen in class.
