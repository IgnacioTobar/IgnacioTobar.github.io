## Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations

The paper describes the deep neural network architecture used for recommending videos in YouTube. This system is separated in two layers: a neural network for *candidate generation*, which out of millions of videos choose a few hundred possible candidates for recommendation, and a *ranking* neural net, which provides a more personalized ranking out of the videos chosen previously. 

By using embeddings from the videos, the watch history of the user, the age of the video, and other kinds of metadata (both of the video and the user), the paper proves this method is capable to outperform previous matrix factorization methods, while also being efficient when used on a much bigger dataset that those normally used for these kind of problems.

One problem of this paper is that, maybe because how big the weight of the company behind it is, it kinds of gloss over the exact dataset and methodology used, meaning the paper can't be really reproduced or tested to verify  its claims, and improve upon it.
